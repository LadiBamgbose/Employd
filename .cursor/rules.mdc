# Employd – Cursor Rules

## Product
Employd is an AI-guided resume builder.
Users enter basic information, the system asks targeted follow-up questions, rewrites resume content, and outputs a polished, ATS-friendly resume (PDF + preview).

## Repo Structure
This is a monorepo.

- apps/web → Next.js frontend (App Router)
- apps/api → FastAPI backend (Python)
- packages → shared code (types, utils) if needed later

Do not change the repo structure unless explicitly instructed.

## Brand & Design
- Brand colors:
  - White
  - Soft pink (primary accent)
  - Neutral greys
- Overall feel:
  - Clean
  - Modern
  - Premium
  - Friendly but professional
- Avoid harsh blacks or overly saturated colors
- Use color sparingly for emphasis (CTAs, highlights, focus states)

## Frontend (apps/web)
- Framework: Next.js (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript
- UI Library: React
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Animations: **Framer Motion (use heavily)**

### UI Principles
- Highly interactive and visually appealing
- Smooth, deliberate animations
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Fully responsive (mobile → desktop)
- No fixed widths unless explicitly requested
- Subtle shadows, rounded corners, generous spacing

### React Best Practices (important)
- Use functional components only
- Keep components small and focused
- Prefer composition over large monolithic components
- Use client components only when necessary
- Keep state local where possible
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Clean separation between layout, logic, and UI

### Framer Motion Rules
- Prefer Framer Motion over CSS-only animations
- Use motion for:
  - page transitions
  - section reveals
  - hover and tap interactions
  - list/item entrance animations
- Animations should feel smooth, intentional, and polished
- Avoid excessive or distracting motion, but default to animation where it adds delight

## Backend (apps/api)
- Framework: FastAPI
- Language: Python
- Use a virtual environment (.venv)
- Entry point: app/main.py
- Do not assume Node.js or Prisma on the backend
- Database will be added later (likely Postgres + SQLModel)

## AI
- Primary model provider: Anthropic (Claude)
- AI is used to:
  - detect missing resume information
  - ask follow-up questions
  - rewrite bullets and summaries
- Do not invent user data
- Prefer structured outputs (JSON) when possible

## Coding Style
- Be explicit and readable over clever
- Small steps, minimal abstraction
- Explain changes when requested
- When teaching, go one step at a time and wait for confirmation

## What NOT to do
- Do not add unnecessary libraries
- Do not refactor unless explicitly asked
- Do not assume features that were not discussed
- Do not skip explanation when the user is learning
